### FarmTemperatureWarningSystem  

#### Introduction  
**FarmTemperatureWarningSystem** is a smart application developed to help farmers monitor and control the temperature in their farms. The system ensures an optimal environment for crops and livestock by providing real-time temperature tracking, alerts, and device control. This project is designed to improve farm management efficiency and reduce risks related to unsuitable environmental conditions.

#### Features  
1. **Temperature Alerts:**  
   - Allows users to set temperature thresholds.  
   - Automatically compares real-time temperatures with user-defined limits and sends alerts when thresholds are exceeded.  

2. **Alert Device Control:**  
   - Users can remotely turn on/off warning lights through the mobile app.  
   - Option to schedule automatic on/off times for alert devices.  

3. **User-Friendly Interface:**  
   - Displays current temperature and control options on the HomeScreen.  
   - Provides an easy way to set and adjust temperature limits.  

#### Technologies Used  
1. **Front-end:**  
   - Built using **React Native**, offering seamless cross-platform support for web and mobile applications.  

2. **Back-end:**  
   - Developed with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, ensuring efficient data processing and application logic.  

3. **IoT Integration:**  
   - Utilizes **Arduino Code** and the **DHT11 sensor** to collect real-time temperature data.  
   - Includes the **HC-05 Bluetooth module** for wireless communication between devices and the application.
