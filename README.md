### Project Summary: FarmTemperatureWarningSystem

**FarmTemperatureWarningSystem** is an application designed to help farmers monitor and manage temperature levels in their farms, ensuring an optimal environment for crops and livestock. The main features of the system include:

1. **Temperature Alerts:**
   - Users can set desired temperature thresholds.
   - The app automatically compares real-time temperatures with the thresholds and provides alerts when the limits are exceeded.

2. **Alert Device Control:**
   - Turn on/off warning lights through the mobile app.
   - Schedule automatic on/off times for the alert devices.

3. **User Interface:**
   - A HomeScreen displaying current temperatures and control options.
   - Functionality to input desired temperature limits.

4. **Technologies Used:**
   - **Front-end:** React Native for seamless cross-platform support on web and mobile.
   - **Back-end:** Node.js (with Express.js) to handle data processing and application logic.
   - **IoT Integration:** Arduino Code combined with a DHT11 sensor and HC-05 bluetooth module for real-time temperature data collection.
